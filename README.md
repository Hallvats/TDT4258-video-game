Let's get it

Decisions regarding game-logic and -mechanics:

1.  Gravity or suspended blocks.
    Suspended. Easier and how it is in the classic version.
2.  Random piece-queue generator?
3.  Board- and piece-data representation. (Arrays, which data types etc. E.g. pieces as chars 'I', 'J', 'L', 'O', 'S', 'Z', 'T')
4.  Board size in blocks. Standard is 10x20, with an extra four blocks height to allow for blocs to spawn.
